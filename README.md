This is a fork of PhotoSwipe that is used to create image based quizzes
=======================================================================

If you want the real PhotoSwipe without my added bugs and functionnalities go [there](https://github.com/codecomputerlove/PhotoSwipe)

This will probably be a bit fastly done, not very generic, not perfect : I needed the functionnality for another project, but if someone needs something of the sort feel free to make it better (remember to let her into your heart, though).

Changelog
---------

* v0.2 : 
** messages are now an overlay (not an alert), we can therefore put real html in there.
** known bugs and backlog :
*** O.K.E: the keyboards events are not modified when the overlay is put and the carousel below is therefore still operationnal, something should be done about this someday
*** settings : in DialogOverlay.initialize(), use the settings
* v0.1 : Added quizzesâ€¦
